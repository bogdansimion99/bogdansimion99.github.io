### This project was done in part to satisfy the requirements for the Seminar Computer Vision by Deep Learning course at TU Delft.
### We aim to reproduce and to improve some parts of the paper "TenniSet: A Dataset for Dense Fine-Grained Event Recognition, Localisation and Description". In this blog we’ll be elaborating on our efforts to reproduce the results, the issues we faced and the discussion about the possibility of reproducing the paper.

## Introduction

### Sports, like every field, has enjoyed a steep advancement in technologies and algorithms. This is also the case for tennis. Since Hawk-Eye developement [1] many algorithms detecting the players' action, the score and tracking the ball were made. Some of the recent improvements in the field were encompassed by TrackNet [2], which trains a deep learning network, addressing the problem of tracking fast moving tiny objects and Optical Flow [3], a currently widely used technique for detecting moving objects. In terms of datasets, an important advancement was made by Faulkner and Dick [4], who created the TenniSet, a dataset focused on event detection based on the players movements and ball's position. However, we found some flaws: the slow computation time makes it impossible to use these approaches for any real-time analysis of a tennis match, useful in all the topics described above and these techniques are not yet cheap and viable ways to create an annotated dataset that could be further used in research. Further, we would like to divide our discussion into several parts: the previous work related to annotation using computer vision in sports; our project goals and what we are trying to implement; the results we have for this setting and in the end, the discussion about the results and issues we faced.
